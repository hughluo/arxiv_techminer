# Technology Identification

## Tools
* arxiv.py handles the xml file from arxiv.org and convert it to txt to prepare for HLTA
* vanilla_lda.py wrap lda by Scikit_Learn to use txt file we get from arxiv.py to do the vanilla favor LDA


## Notes
* However, how to define the abstraction level of "Technology" is ambiguous.
* Status quo of R&D should be monitoring.
* As an unsupervised learning task, how to evaluate the performance (likelihood, etc.) However, plausibility is questionable

## TODO
* Patent data contains only short description?
* How different variants of LDA perform?

* [HLTA on Github and related Paper](https://github.com/kmpoon/hlta)
